# Findmypast coding exerciseâ€”prime tables

## Improvements after submitting to Findmypast

### 2022-04-06 
* Explored the math module and implemented its `isqrt()` function rather than 
using `int(potential_prime**(1/2))`. Doesn't impact time efficiency but looks a 
lot better and is easier to read. Also, math is a built-in module so there are 
still no required dependencies to install.
* Removed the padding function. This task can be accomplished by simply using 
the `.rjust()` string method.
* Created a separate function that generates the multiplication table. This is 
useful as it means the generation of the multiples can be tested. It also makes
the program more extensible as the user could be offered options as to how they 
want their table displayed, e.g. in the console, returned as a csv. This output
would also be easier to pass to the front end if one was to be built.
* Simplified the `print_table()` function as it now prints from a list of lists
generated from the `multiplication_table()` function.

## 1. Task

Write an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a 
multiplication table of (N) prime numbers.
* Please write an algorithm to solve the prime number generation. Do not use a 
library method to generate your primes.
* You should input a whole number N, where is N is at least 1.
* The application should output an N+1 x N+1 grid of numbers.

Expected primes multiplication table when N is 3:  
```
|  | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| 2 | 4 | 6 | 10 |
| 3 | 6 | 9 | 15 |
| 5 | 10 | 15 | 25 |
```


## 2. How to run

Run:  
`python3 prime_tables/main.py`

Run tests:  
`python3 -m unittest discover tests "test_*.py`  

Example run:

## 3. What I'm pleased with

* The good alignment of the table values through the use of the padding 
function.
* The simple, clear structure and names of the directories and files, which 
allow for easy extension (I have commented in the files how I could extend).
* Clear documentation, function/variable names and commenting.
* Improvement in the time efficiency of the find primes algorithm from my first 
attempt (reduced time to calculate 10,000 primes from ~34.65s to ~0.18s)


## 4. What I would do with more time

* Improve the print_table function. Although I like the way the output looks in 
the console, the function is long and not very efficient, calculating each value 
one at a time and containing multiple loops and if statements. By its nature, a 
multiplication table contains duplicate values so there must be a way to 
generate it without repeated calculations. I would also explore other data 
structures and libraries to see if there is a better/easier way of creating a 
table.
* Once the efficiency of print_table was improved, I would look at improving the 
efficiency of finding primes by using a sieve algorithm such as the Sieve of 
Erathosthenes.
* Increase unit test coverage by mocking.
* Refactor into OOP to improve extensibility.
* Explore other output formats as it gets very difficult to view a large table in 
the console, and it does not display nicely with line wrapping on.
