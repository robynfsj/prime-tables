# Findmypast coding exerciseâ€”prime tables


## 1. Task

Write an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a 
multiplication table of (N) prime numbers.
* Please write an algorithm to solve the prime number generation. Do not use a 
library method to generate your primes.
* You should input a whole number N, where is N is at least 1.
* The application should output an N+1 x N+1 grid of numbers.

Expected primes multiplication table when N is 3:  
`|   |  2 |  3 |  5 |`  
`| 2 |  4 |  6 | 10 |`   
`| 3 |  6 |  9 | 15 |`   
`| 5 | 10 | 15 | 25 |`
